# Putting it All Together
*by Matteo Persiani*
## Based on Lab 4
### How I Did it the First Time
* The first time doing this lab task, I used the search function in bash to search for my past commands to complete the assigned task fairly quick.

### Doing it with a Bash Script
* This time, I've written a bash script to do some of the assigned tasks for me. Similarly to the first time, I will do the setup manually and log into my `ieng6` account the same way. After that though, one command is all I need to run to complete the rest of the tasks.

The script I wrote

##### 1. Setup: Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
* First, I need to delete my old fork. To do this I'll navigate to the settings tab of lab7 and then scroll down to the "Delete this repository" button and click it.

* I also need to delete the lab7 repo from my ieng6 account so to do this I'll type `rm -rf lab7` and then `<enter>`.

`rm -rf` is a command to delete a directory without any confirmation pop ups.

##### 2. Setup: Fork the repository
* Next, I'll fork the repository by creating a new fork of lab7. To do this I'll click "Fork" in the top right of the lab7 repository and then "Create fork."

##### 3. The real deal: Start the timer!
* Now I'll start a timer.

##### 4. Log into ieng6
* Keys pressed: `<up><up><enter`

The `ssh cs15lwi23ads@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command gives me remote access to my ieng6 account.

##### 5. Running the script
* Keys pressed: `<up><up><enter`

##### Stop the Timer!
* 5 seconds! Much quicker than anything I could've done by hand.
